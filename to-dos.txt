Fix the appearance and function of the file input box:
 1. Remove the file input box and its kludgey prompt
 2. Give an ID to that column
 3. Define a function inside the server function that removes all content of that column
    and then replaces it with the appropriate text input and prompt
 4. Call that function in the current observeEvent() handler

Use three different names for the three different file inputs,
so that each saves its last content separately.
This is most convenient for the users.
