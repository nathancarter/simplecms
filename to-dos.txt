Instead of your tags$textarea call, with a hacked label, use the new textarea support (2 instances).

Make a separate file and move into it all the preferences utilities.
Then change them so that they aren't accessed through a global variable,
but through a getPreference() function.
Source that file in simpleCMSAddin.R and switch all preferences$x expressions to getPreference('x').
Move the studentPath() function and its friends into that file as well.
Allow the toggling of the global TESTING variable with a setTesting() function; default is false.
Create a preferenceNames() function that gets the list of preferences keys.
Replace the observeEvent() call sequence for preferences with a loop through that list of keys.

Fix the appearance and function of the file input box:
 1. Remove the file input box and its kludgey prompt
 2. Give an ID to that column
 3. Define a function inside the server function that removes all content of that column
    and then replaces it with the appropriate text input and prompt
 4. Call that function in the current observeEvent() handler

Use three different names for the three different file inputs,
so that each saves its last content separately.
This is most convenient for the users.
